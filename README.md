# 👋 Hi, I'm Wojciech

**Front-End Developer (React + TypeScript)** with a B.Eng. in Computer Science.  
I enjoy building modern, responsive web applications and focusing on clean architecture, readable code, and good UX.

⚙**I develop backend features with Node/Express in my own projects, improving my ability to build complete Full-Stack applications.**
